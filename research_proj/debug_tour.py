"""
RUN_SCOPE: string
    Defines the scope of run. ex: dev, first strategy set, second strategy set, all strategies;
SINGLE_RUN: bool
    Defines the type of run. 
    True: single run;
    False: multiple runs with a constant DEVIATION that changes by a fixed step;
    REQUIRES STEP TO BE DEFINED!
STEP: int
    A value by which the value of the DEVIATION decreases.
    The desired behaviour is to start with a large deviation and get close to 0, meaning a default tournament.
DISTRIBUTION: string
    The type of distribution from where the number of turns are extracted.
    normal: normal distribution
    uniform: uniform distribution
TURNS: int
    Number of turns in a supergame. A single turn round is a simple game.
REPETITIONS: int
    The number of repetitions of a supergame.
